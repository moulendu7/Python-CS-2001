# **README – Python Laboratory Experiments**

## **Experiment 1: Variables and Operators Lab**

**Objective:**
Practice the basic concepts of Python programming, including:

* Working with variables
* Understanding different data types
* Using arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators
* Evaluating and combining expressions

---

## **Experiment 2: Python Decision-Making and Loops Lab**

**Objective:**
Understand and practice Python’s decision-making and looping structures, such as:

* `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
* Nested decision-making
* `for` and `while` loops
* Nested loops
* Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)

---

## **Experiment 3: Python Functions and Modules Lab**

**Objective:**
Develop skills in modular and reusable programming by learning:

* Defining and calling custom functions
* Organizing code using functions
* Understanding variable scope (local and global)
* Using and manipulating data structures
* Working with dates and time
* Importing built-in and external modules
* Writing programs using functions, modules, and packages

---

## **Experiment 4 & 5: File Operations and MicroPython Lab**

**Objective:**
Gain practical experience with file handling and MicroPython programming, focusing on:

1. **File I/O Basics:**

   * Reading and writing text files
   * Working with CSV and binary files

2. **Exception Handling:**

   * Handling file-related errors using `try`, `except`, and other blocks

3. **Practical Applications:**

   * Logging and retrieving data from files
   * Implementing basic file operations

4. **MicroPython Programming:**

   * Reading sensor data (e.g., DHT11)
   * Writing sensor readings to local storage or SD card
   * Reading the CSV file to verify logged data
